    "description": "Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor, Op. 27 No. 2, nicknamed the \"Moonlight Sonata\" by poet Ludwig Rellstab, is one of the most recognisable works in the piano repertoire. Composed in 1801 and dedicated to Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, the sonata broke conventions by opening with a slow, meditative Adagio sostenuto rather than a fast movement.\n\nThe famous first movement features a repeating triplet figure over a singing melody in the bass, creating a hypnotic, almost improvisatory atmosphere. The second movement is a lighter Allegretto that serves as a brief respite, while the third movement erupts into a fiery Presto agitato full of dramatic arpeggios and powerful octaves. The first movement is accessible to intermediate players, though the third movement demands advanced technique.",

Composed around 1810, the piece was not published during Beethoven's lifetime \u2014 it was discovered in 1867 by Ludwig Nohl, and the identity of \"Elise\" remains a mystery to this day.\n\nStructured as a rondo (A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013C\u2013A), the main theme is gentle and approachable, making it one of the first classical pieces many students learn. The B section introduces a warmer, more lyrical passage in F major, while the C section brings unexpected drama with rapid arpeggios and a stormy character. The main theme is ideal for beginners, while performing the complete piece with all three sections requires a solid intermediate foundation.",

Its simplicity makes it one of the most accessible introductions to Bach's keyboard music, yet its harmonic richness rewards close listening. The piece later inspired Gounod to compose his famous \"Ave Maria\" as a melody over Bach's original harmonies.",

With its sparse texture and gentle dissonances, the first Gymnop\u00e9die was decades ahead of its time, anticipating the impressionist and ambient music movements.\n\nThe piece is marked \"Lent et douloureux\" (slowly and sorrowfully) and consists of a simple, wistful melody floating over alternating major seventh and minor seventh chords in a gentle 3/4 waltz rhythm. Its technical simplicity \u2014 mostly single notes in the right hand and two-note chords in the left \u2014 makes it accessible to beginners, though capturing its dreamy mood requires musical sensitivity and careful use of the sustain pedal.",

Chopin's writing imitates the art of bel canto singing, with graceful turns, trills, and cadenza-like passages that demand both technical fluency and expressive nuance.

Composed in 1847, legend has it that Chopin was inspired by watching George Sand's little dog chase its own tail.\n\nThe waltz opens with a whirling, descending figure that spins continuously before giving way to a gentler, more lyrical middle section in the relative minor. The return of the opening theme brings the piece to a sparkling close. Despite its brevity \u2014 roughly one and a half minutes at a moderate tempo \u2014 it requires nimble fingerwork and elegant phrasing, making it an excellent study piece for intermediate pianists building speed and lightness of touch.",

Mozart's writing captures both the exotic flavour of the \"alla turca\" style and his own inimitable wit and elegance. The piece is a perennial favourite at recitals and a staple of the intermediate repertoire, requiring clean articulation, rhythmic precision, and a sense of fun.",

The sonata was an immediate success and remains one of Beethoven's most frequently performed piano works.\n\nThe first movement opens with a grave, imposing introduction that returns twice during the turbulent Allegro, creating an almost operatic sense of drama. The second movement, Adagio cantabile, is one of the most beautiful slow movements in the entire piano literature \u2014 a serene, singing melody in A-flat major.

    "description": "The Maple Leaf Rag, published in 1899, was one of the first pieces of sheet music to sell over one million copies and is the composition that launched the ragtime craze across America. Named after the Maple Leaf Club in Sedalia, Missouri, where Joplin performed regularly, it secured his reputation as the \"King of Ragtime\" and influenced generations of popular music.\n\nThe rag follows the classic ragtime structure of four distinct 16-bar strains (AA BB A CC DD), each featuring Joplin's trademark syncopated melodies in the right hand set against a steady \"oom-pah\" bass pattern in the left. The syncopation gives the music its infectious, toe-tapping energy, while the harmonic progressions reveal a sophistication that elevates ragtime far beyond mere novelty. Joplin insisted his rags should not be played too fast \u2014 \"It is never right to play ragtime fast,\" he wrote on his scores.",

    "description": "Liebestraum No. 3, meaning \"Dream of Love,\" is the most famous of Liszt's three Liebestr\u00e4ume, originally composed as songs and later transcribed for solo piano around 1850. The third Liebestraum is based on a poem by Ferdinand Freiligrath, \"O lieb, so lang du lieben kannst\" (\"O love, as long as you can love\"), and its music captures the poem's theme of passionate, fleeting love.\n\nThe piece opens with a tender, arching melody above a gently rocking accompaniment in A-flat major. As the music progresses, the emotional intensity builds through increasingly rich harmonies and virtuosic cadenzas, reaching an impassioned climax before subsiding back to the opening tenderness. The Liebestraum demands a wide dynamic range, expressive rubato, and the ability to project a singing tone through complex textures \u2014 quintessential Liszt challenges for the advanced pianist.",

    "description": "Chopin's Prelude No. 4 in E minor is one of the most emotionally concentrated pieces in the piano repertoire. At just 25 bars and roughly two minutes in length, it packs an extraordinary depth of feeling into the smallest possible space. It was famously played at Chopin's own funeral in 1849, orchestrated for the occasion by Napoleon Henri Reber.\n\nThe piece consists of a descending melody in the right hand \u2014 simple, almost vocal in character \u2014 accompanied by slowly shifting chords in the left hand that create a chromatic, descending harmonic progression. The effect is one of profound melancholy and resignation, building to a quiet but devastating cadence. Its technical simplicity makes it accessible to beginners, yet its emotional depth makes it a lifelong companion for performers at every level.",
