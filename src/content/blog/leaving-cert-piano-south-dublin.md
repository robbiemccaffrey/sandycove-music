If you're taking Leaving Cert Music and piano is your performance instrument, the good news is that you're working with the most versatile instrument for the exam. Piano gives you the widest range of repertoire to choose from, and South Dublin has some excellent piano teachers who can help you prepare.

Here's a practical guide to getting the most from your Leaving Cert piano performance.

## Why the Performance Matters So Much

The performance component is worth 50% of your total Leaving Cert Music mark. That's a huge chunk of your grade, and it's the one area where focused, one-on-one preparation with a good teacher has the biggest impact.

The listening and composing papers reward study and practice too, but the performance is where personal tuition really pays off. A good piano teacher will help you choose the right pieces, develop your technique, build your confidence, and present a programme that maximises your mark.

## Choosing Your Pieces

This is one of the most important decisions you'll make, and it's worth getting advice from an experienced teacher. Here's the general approach:

**Go for variety.** Examiners want to see range. A strong programme includes pieces from different styles and periods — classical, jazz, pop, contemporary, Irish traditional. Six similar pieces won't score as well as a varied programme.

**Aim above the minimum.** While all six pieces need to be at least Grade 6 standard, including one or two pieces at Grade 7 or 8 shows the examiner you're performing above the baseline. This signals ambition and ability.

**Play to your strengths.** Choose pieces you genuinely enjoy playing. Enjoyment comes through in a performance — examiners can tell the difference between a student who loves what they're playing and one who's just getting through it.

**Consider including your own composition.** This is one of the best-kept secrets of the Leaving Cert performance. Original compositions show creativity and a deeper understanding of music. If you write music, this is a brilliant way to stand out.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Having worked with many Leaving Cert students, here are the mistakes we see most often:

- **Choosing pieces that are too difficult.** It's better to play a Grade 6 piece beautifully than to struggle through a Grade 8 piece. Quality over difficulty, every time.
- **Leaving preparation too late.** Ideally, start choosing pieces in 5th Year or early 6th Year. Cramming in the final few weeks rarely produces the best results.
- **Neglecting musicality.** Examiners aren't just checking if you hit the right notes. They're listening for dynamics, phrasing, expression, and interpretation. These are the things that separate good performances from great ones.
- **Not practising performance conditions.** Playing in your bedroom is different from performing in front of an examiner. Regular run-throughs in exam-like conditions — with an audience, or at least a recording device — build the confidence you need on the day.

## Finding a Piano Teacher for Leaving Cert in South Dublin

If you're in South Dublin and looking for a piano teacher to help with Leaving Cert preparation, here's what to look for:

- **Leaving Cert experience** — Not all piano teachers have experience with the specific requirements of the Leaving Cert performance exam. Make sure yours understands the marking criteria and knows what examiners are looking for.
- **Programme guidance** — A good teacher won't just teach you the notes. They'll help you select pieces that work well together and present you as a well-rounded musician.
- **Performance coaching** — Beyond technique, you need to develop exam-day confidence. Look for a teacher who incorporates performance practice into your lessons.
- **Flexibility** — With 6th Year being demanding, you need a teacher who can work around your school schedule and ramp up lesson frequency when exam time approaches.

## A Preparation Timeline

Here's a rough guide that's worked well for our students:

**5th Year / Early 6th Year:** Choose your six pieces. Start learning the notes and getting comfortable with each one. This is exploratory — you can swap pieces later if something isn't working.

**September–December (6th Year):** Solidify your programme. Focus on technique, accuracy, and learning each piece thoroughly.

**January–March:** Shift focus to musicality and expression — dynamics, phrasing, pedalling, interpretation. This is where performances go from competent to compelling.

**Final weeks:** Polish and perform. Regular full run-throughs in exam conditions. Focus on strong openings, confident endings, and composure. Record yourself and listen back critically.
