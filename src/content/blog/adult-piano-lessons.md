We get a lot of enquiries from adults who want to learn piano but feel like they've "left it too late." Whether you're 25 or 65, the idea of starting something new can feel daunting — especially when you imagine a room full of talented 8-year-olds who've been playing since they were five.

Here's the truth: it's never too late to learn piano, and adult learners often have significant advantages that children don't.

## Why Adults Make Great Piano Students

There's a myth that you need to start young to be any good at an instrument. While it's true that children's brains are highly adaptable, adults bring their own strengths to the table:

**Motivation.** You're choosing to do this. Nobody is making you practise. That intrinsic motivation is incredibly powerful and will carry you through the difficult early stages far more effectively than a parent nagging a reluctant child.

**Life experience with music.** You've spent decades listening to music. You have an intuitive sense of melody, rhythm, and expression that a 6-year-old simply doesn't have yet. This musical understanding accelerates your learning enormously.

**Focus and discipline.** Adults can concentrate for longer, understand abstract concepts more easily, and follow structured practice plans. When we explain the theory behind what you're playing, it clicks faster because you have the cognitive framework for it.

**Clear goals.** Most adult learners know exactly what they want. Some want to play their favourite songs. Others want to work through the grades. Some want to play jazz at sessions. Having a clear goal makes lessons more efficient and progress more satisfying.

## What to Expect

If you've never played piano before, here's roughly what those first few months look like:

**Weeks 1-4:** You'll learn the basics — how to sit, hand position, reading simple notation, and playing with both hands separately. You'll start with short, simple pieces and basic scales. It might feel slow, but you're building a foundation that everything else rests on.

**Months 2-3:** Things start to get interesting. You'll begin playing with both hands together, learn about chords, and start tackling pieces that actually sound like music. This is where most adult learners get their first real buzz of "I can actually play something."

**Months 4-6:** By now you'll have a small repertoire of pieces you can play, a working knowledge of music theory, and the technical skills to start exploring the styles you're most interested in. Some adult students are ready to attempt Grade 1 or 2 pieces by this point.

## Common Concerns (and Why They Shouldn't Stop You)

**"My fingers won't be flexible enough."** Your fingers will adapt. Piano doesn't require extreme flexibility — it requires coordination and practice. Within a few weeks of regular playing, you'll notice a significant improvement in how your hands move.

**"I can't read music."** Neither can most beginners. Reading notation is a skill you'll develop alongside your playing. It's much easier than most people expect, and within a month or two you'll be reading simple pieces without much difficulty.

**"I don't have time to practise."** Even 15-20 minutes a day makes a real difference. You don't need hours — you need consistency. Many of our adult students practise during their lunch break or in the evening after work.

**"I'll never be as good as someone who started as a child."** That depends entirely on what you mean by "good." You probably won't become a concert pianist, but you can absolutely reach a level where you can play pieces you love, perform at social gatherings, pass grade exams, or simply enjoy music as a lifelong hobby. And isn't that the point?

## What Style Should You Learn?

One of the great things about learning as an adult is that you get to choose. There's no exam board dictating what you play (unless you want there to be). Many of our adult students prefer a mix:

- **A bit of classical** for technique and discipline
- **Jazz standards** for expression and improvisation
- **Pop and contemporary** pieces they actually want to play
- **Their own arrangements** of songs they love

We'll work with you to build a programme that keeps you motivated and challenges you in the right ways.

## Do You Need Your Own Piano?

You'll need something to practise on at home. If you're not ready to invest in an acoustic piano, a good digital piano with weighted keys is a perfectly fine starting point. You can pick one up for €400-€700 and it will serve you well for years. We're happy to recommend specific models if you need guidance.
