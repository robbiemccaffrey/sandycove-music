Every piano teacher has said it: "Practice makes perfect." But the truth is, *how* you practice matters far more than how long you practice. A focused 20-minute session will always beat an unfocused hour of noodling through the same pieces.

Whether you're working towards a grade exam, preparing for your Leaving Cert, or learning for fun, here's how to make the most of your practice time.

## Quality Over Quantity

Let's start with the most important principle: it's not about how long you sit at the piano. It's about what you do while you're there.

We've all had practice sessions where we play through our pieces from start to finish a few times, make the same mistakes in the same places, and then close the lid feeling like we've done our duty. That's not practice — that's repetition without improvement.

Effective practice is deliberate. It means identifying the parts that need work, isolating them, and working on them specifically until they improve. Then putting them back into the context of the full piece.

## Structure Your Practice

A good practice session has a clear structure. Here's a framework that works well for most students:

### Warm-Up (5 minutes)
Start with scales, arpeggios, or simple technical exercises. This gets your fingers moving, your brain engaged, and your ears listening. Think of it like stretching before a run.

### Focused Work (10-15 minutes)
This is the core of your practice. Pick one or two specific sections that need improvement and work on them in detail:

- **Slow it down.** If a passage is tricky, play it at half speed. Get it right slowly before you try to play it up to tempo.
- **Hands separately.** If the coordination between your hands is causing problems, practice each hand on its own first.
- **Small sections.** Don't try to fix a whole page at once. Work on 2-4 bars at a time.
- **Repeat with purpose.** Don't just play it over and over — each repetition should have a specific focus. First time: get the notes right. Second time: add dynamics. Third time: work on the phrasing.

### Play-Through (5 minutes)
End by playing through one of your pieces from start to finish. This is your chance to enjoy the music and put everything in context. Try to perform it as if you're playing for an audience — start to finish, no stopping.

## How Often Should You Practice?

Daily practice is ideal, but life gets in the way and that's okay. Here's a realistic guide:

- **5-6 days a week** is the gold standard. Even if some sessions are only 15 minutes, the consistency matters more than the length.
- **3-4 days a week** is good enough to make steady progress, especially if your sessions are focused.
- **Less than 3 days a week** and you'll struggle to retain what you've learned between lessons. You'll spend a lot of your lesson time re-learning rather than progressing.

The key is to make practice a habit. Attach it to something you already do — "after I finish homework" or "before dinner" — and it becomes automatic.

## Common Practice Mistakes

### Always starting from the beginning
If you always start a piece from bar 1, the opening will be polished and the ending will be rough. Start your practice from the difficult sections, or work backwards from the end.

### Playing too fast too soon
Speed is the last thing you add. If you can't play a passage slowly and accurately, you definitely can't play it fast. Use a metronome to gradually increase the tempo only once you're comfortable.

### Ignoring dynamics and expression
It's tempting to focus only on getting the right notes, but dynamics (loud, soft, crescendo, diminuendo) are what make music sound musical. Start adding expression early — don't wait until you've "learned" the piece.

### Not using a metronome
A metronome keeps you honest about your timing. Many students speed up during easy sections and slow down during difficult ones without realising it. Even occasional metronome practice helps develop a strong internal pulse.

### Practising your strengths, not your weaknesses
We all prefer to play the parts we're good at. It feels nice. But the sections that need the most work are the ones you should be spending the most time on.

## Practice Tips for Exam Preparation

If you're working towards a RIAM, ABRSM, Trinity, or Leaving Cert exam, your practice needs to be especially focused:

- **Divide your time** between your performance pieces, scales/arpeggios, sight-reading, and aural skills. Don't neglect any component.
- **Record yourself** and listen back. You'll hear things you miss while you're playing — uneven rhythm, inconsistent dynamics, rushing.
- **Practice performing.** Play your pieces for family or friends regularly. Getting used to an audience, even a small one, reduces nerves on exam day.
- **Simulate exam conditions.** Once you're close to the exam, do a full run-through of your programme without stopping, just as you would in the exam.

## Set Goals for Each Session

Before you sit down, decide what you want to achieve. "Practice piano" is vague. "Get bars 12-16 of my Bach piece up to tempo" is specific and achievable. Small, clear goals make practice feel productive and give you a sense of accomplishment.

## Making It Enjoyable

If practice feels like a chore every single time, something needs to change. Here are a few ways to keep it enjoyable:

- **Play something you love** at the end of each session, even if it's not part of your current repertoire.
- **Learn a piece just for fun** alongside your exam pieces.
- **Track your progress.** Keep a practice diary or tick off pieces and sections as you master them.
- **Celebrate milestones.** Mastered a tricky passage? Finished learning a new piece? That's worth acknowledging.

The best practice habit is one you actually enjoy enough to keep doing. If you need help building better practice habits, that's something we work on with all our students at Sandycove School of Music — [get in touch](/#contact) and we'll help you find an approach that works.
