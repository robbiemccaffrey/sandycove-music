Finding the right piano teacher can make the difference between a student who loves music and one who gives up after six months. With so many options in Dublin — from private teachers to music schools to online platforms — it's worth taking the time to find the right fit. Here's what we'd recommend looking for.

## Qualifications and Experience

A good piano teacher should have formal training in music. Look for a degree in music (BA, BMus, or equivalent), a teaching diploma, or high-grade qualifications from recognised exam boards like RIAM, ABRSM, or Trinity College London.

Experience matters too, but it's not just about years. Ask about the kinds of students they've taught — beginners, advanced, children, adults, exam preparation. A teacher who has prepared students for grade exams will understand the syllabus inside out and know exactly what examiners are looking for.

## Teaching Style

This is arguably the most important factor, and it's the one that's hardest to assess without actually trying a lesson. A great piano teacher adapts their approach to each student rather than using a one-size-fits-all method.

Some things to consider:

- **Do they make lessons enjoyable?** Especially for children, lessons should be engaging and fun, not just drilling exercises.
- **Do they set clear goals?** Good teachers help students work towards something, whether that's a grade exam, a recital, or simply mastering a piece they love.
- **Are they patient?** Learning an instrument involves a lot of repetition and occasional frustration. A patient, encouraging teacher makes all the difference.
- **Can they teach your preferred style?** If you want to learn jazz or pop as well as classical, make sure your teacher is comfortable across those styles.

## Location and Convenience

Consistency is key to musical progress, so think about logistics. A teacher who's a 45-minute drive away might seem worth it at first, but after a few months of weekly trips, it can become a barrier.

In Dublin, you've got plenty of options across the city and suburbs. We're based in Sandycove, Co. Dublin — easy to reach from Glasthule, Dalkey, Dun Laoghaire, Monkstown, and Blackrock. We also offer online lessons for those who prefer to learn from home.

## Trial Lessons

Most good teachers offer a trial or introductory lesson. Take advantage of this. It gives you a chance to see how the teacher interacts with you or your child, whether the environment feels comfortable, and whether the teaching approach suits your learning style.

Things to notice during a trial lesson:

- Does the teacher listen to what you want to achieve?
- Do they explain things clearly?
- Does the student leave feeling motivated and excited?
- Is the pace appropriate — not too fast, not too slow?

## What to Ask

When you're talking to a potential teacher, here are some useful questions:

- **What exam boards do you prepare students for?** (In Ireland, the main ones are RIAM, ABRSM, and Trinity.)
- **What's your approach with beginners?** This tells you a lot about their teaching philosophy.
- **How do you handle practice?** A good teacher will have a clear view on how students should practise at home.
- **What ages and levels do you teach?** Some teachers specialise in young children, others in advanced students. Make sure they have experience with your level.
- **Do you do recitals or performance opportunities?** Playing for others is an important part of musical development.

## Red Flags

While most piano teachers are dedicated professionals, there are a few warning signs to watch for:

- **No formal qualifications or reluctance to discuss them.** A good teacher should be happy to share their background.
- **Rigid, one-size-fits-all approach.** Every student is different. If a teacher uses the exact same method with every student regardless of age, ability, or interest, that's a concern.
- **No clear lesson structure.** Lessons should have a purpose, even if the approach is flexible.
- **Pressure to buy expensive materials immediately.** A couple of beginner books are normal, but you shouldn't need to invest heavily upfront.
