The Leaving Cert Music performance component is worth 50% of your overall mark, so it's well worth putting the time in to get it right. The good news is that with the right preparation and a well-chosen programme, you can walk into that exam feeling confident. Here's our guide to making the most of it.

## Your Two Options

When it comes to the performance exam, you have two paths to choose from:

1. **Six pieces**, each at a minimum of Grade 6 standard
2. **Four pieces** at Grade 4 standard or above, **plus a music technology component**

Both are perfectly valid routes, but if you have the ability, **we'd strongly recommend going with the six pieces**. It gives you the best opportunity to showcase your range as a musician and tends to score higher overall.

## Choosing Your Six Pieces

This is where the fun starts. You want to build a programme that shows variety, musicality, and confidence. Think of it as a mini recital — you're telling the examiner a story about who you are as a musician.

### Go for Variety

Choose pieces across a range of styles. A strong programme might include:

- **A classical piece** — a Beethoven sonata movement, a Bach invention, or similar
- **A jazz standard** — something with space for expression and interpretation
- **A contemporary or modern piece** — film music, a modern classical work, or a technical showpiece
- **A pop or rock arrangement** — done well, this can really stand out
- **An Irish traditional piece** — a great way to show cultural awareness
- **Your own composition** — yes, you absolutely can perform your own work, and examiners love to see originality

You don't have to follow this exact split, but aim for at least three or four different styles. A programme of six similar pieces won't score as well as one that demonstrates breadth.

### Aim High with a Couple of Pieces

While all six pieces need to be played to a Grade 6 standard, not every piece needs to literally be from a Grade 6 book. Some can be slightly easier pieces played really well. However, **we'd suggest including at least one or two pieces at Grade 7 or Grade 8 level**. This signals to the examiner that you're performing above the minimum standard and can handle more demanding repertoire.

A strong approach:

- **2 pieces at Grade 7/8** — your showpieces, the ones you're most proud of
- **3 pieces at Grade 6** — solid, well-prepared performances
- **1 slightly easier piece** played beautifully — better to play a Grade 5 piece with real musicality than struggle through something too difficult

### Quality Over Difficulty

This is crucial. Examiners aren't just ticking off how hard the piece is — they're listening for musicality, expression, dynamics, and confidence. A piece played musically and with feeling will always outscore a harder piece played with mistakes and tension. Choose repertoire you genuinely enjoy playing, because that enjoyment comes through in a performance.

## Using Your Own Compositions

One of the best-kept secrets of the Leaving Cert Music performance is that **you can include your own compositions** in your programme. If you write music — whether that's classical, pop, jazz, or anything in between — this is a brilliant way to stand out. Original compositions show creativity and a deeper understanding of music.

Just make sure your composition is genuinely at the required standard and that you can perform it confidently. Have your teacher review it well in advance.

## Preparation Timeline

Here's a rough guide to how we'd approach it:

**September–November (5th Year or early 6th Year):** Choose your six pieces. Start learning the notes and getting comfortable with each one.

**December–February:** Focus on refining technique and expression. This is where the real work happens — dynamics, phrasing, pedalling, and interpretation.

**March–April:** Run through your full programme regularly. Record yourself and listen back. Perform for family, friends, or at school recitals to build confidence.

**Final weeks:** Polish, don't panic. Focus on strong openings and confident endings for each piece. Practice performing in exam-like conditions.
