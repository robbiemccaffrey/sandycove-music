If your child is taking Junior Cycle Music and playing piano for the practical exam, getting some focused preparation in early can make a real difference. The practical performance is a significant part of the assessment, and with the right approach, it's also one of the most rewarding parts of the course.

Here's what parents and students need to know.

## What the Practical Exam Involves

The Junior Cycle Music practical exam requires students to perform three pieces. These can be solo performances, group performances, or a mix of the two. For piano students, at least one or two solo performances is common — and it's a great way to showcase individual ability.

The examiner is assessing three things:

- **Fluency** — Can the student play through the piece smoothly and confidently?
- **Technical control** — Are the notes accurate? Is the tempo steady? Is the pedalling and fingering clean?
- **Musicality** — Is the student playing with expression, dynamics, and feeling? This is what separates good performances from great ones.

Students also sit a short unprepared test. This is either sight-reading, aural memory, or improvisation — and the good news is that regular piano lessons naturally build all of these skills over time.

## Why Piano Is a Great Choice for Junior Cycle

Piano is one of the most popular instruments for the Junior Cycle Music practical, and for good reason:

- **Versatility** — Piano works across every style, from classical to pop to jazz. This gives students plenty of choice when picking their three pieces.
- **Theory and sight-reading** — Learning piano develops music theory and sight-reading skills that directly benefit the written exam and CBAs too.
- **Solo capability** — Unlike many instruments, piano sounds complete on its own. A solo piano performance can be just as impressive as a full ensemble piece.
- **Foundation for Leaving Cert** — Students who develop strong piano skills at Junior Cycle are well positioned for the Leaving Cert Music performance, where the bar is higher but the skills are the same.

## Choosing the Right Pieces

Piece selection matters more than most students realise. Here's what works well:

**Show variety.** Choose three pieces in different styles. A classical piece, something contemporary or from a film, and a jazz or pop arrangement makes for a well-rounded programme. Examiners appreciate range.

**Play to your strengths.** Choose pieces your child can play confidently and musically, not pieces that push them to their technical limit. A Grade 3 piece played beautifully will score higher than a Grade 5 piece full of mistakes.

**Pick music you enjoy.** It sounds obvious, but students who genuinely like their pieces perform them with more energy and expression. The examiner can tell.

**Get advice from your teacher.** An experienced piano teacher will know which pieces work well in an exam context and can help your child build a programme that shows them at their best.

## When to Start Preparing

Ideally, students should have their three pieces chosen and started by the beginning of third year at the latest. This gives them several months to learn, refine, and polish before the practical exam in March.

A rough timeline:

**September–November:** Choose pieces and learn the notes. Focus on accuracy and getting comfortable with each piece.

**December–January:** Shift focus to expression and musicality. Work on dynamics, phrasing, and tempo. Start doing full run-throughs.

**February–March:** Final polish. Practise performing in front of others — family, friends, or your teacher in exam-like conditions. Focus on confident openings and clean endings.

## The Unprepared Test

This catches some students off guard, but it doesn't need to. The unprepared test options are:

- **Sight-reading** — Playing a short piece you haven't seen before
- **Aural memory** — Listening to a melody and playing it back
- **Improvisation** — Creating a short musical response to a given prompt

Students who take regular piano lessons are already developing these skills week by week. Sight-reading and aural work are natural parts of good piano tuition, so if your child is having consistent lessons, they'll be well prepared for this.

## The Link to Leaving Cert

It's worth thinking ahead. The Leaving Cert Music performance component is worth 50% of the overall mark and requires six pieces at Grade 6 standard or above. Students who build strong piano skills during Junior Cycle have a significant head start.

The technique, sight-reading ability, and performance confidence your child develops now will carry directly into Leaving Cert preparation. Starting early pays off.
