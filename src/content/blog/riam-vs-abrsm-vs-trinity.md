If you're thinking about doing music exams in Ireland, you've probably come across three names: RIAM, ABRSM, and Trinity College London. All three are well-respected, and a grade from any of them carries real weight. But they do differ in some important ways, so it's worth understanding the options before you commit.

Here's our honest take on each one, based on years of preparing students for all three.

## RIAM (Royal Irish Academy of Music)

RIAM is Ireland's own exam board, and it's the most popular choice for piano students here. If you're studying music in Ireland, chances are you'll encounter RIAM at some point.

### What makes RIAM different

RIAM exams tend to have a strong focus on classical repertoire, particularly at the higher grades. The syllabus is well-structured and the examiners are based in Ireland, which means exam sessions are frequent and widely available across the country.

One of the advantages of RIAM is its direct connection to the Royal Irish Academy of Music itself. If your child is considering studying music at third level in Ireland, RIAM grades are very well recognised by Irish universities and conservatories.

### Best for

Students who plan to study or perform in Ireland, those who prefer a classical-focused syllabus, and anyone who wants the most readily available exam sessions around the country.

## ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music)

ABRSM is the largest music exam board in the world, with exams taken in over 90 countries. It's based in the UK and is associated with the Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, and other prestigious institutions.

### What makes ABRSM different

ABRSM has traditionally been very classical in its approach, though in recent years they've broadened their syllabus significantly. Their exams include a strong emphasis on aural tests and sight-reading alongside the performance pieces.

ABRSM's grading is widely recognised internationally, which can be an advantage if your family might relocate or if you're considering studying music abroad. Their theory exams are also very well regarded — you'll need Grade 5 Theory before you can take Grade 6 practical and above.

### Best for

Students aiming for international recognition, those who might study music in the UK, and students who enjoy a rigorous, well-rounded exam structure including theory.

## Trinity College London

Trinity is often seen as the most flexible of the three boards. Their syllabus has always embraced a wider range of styles and they were early to include contemporary, jazz, and popular music alongside classical repertoire.

### What makes Trinity different

Trinity gives you more choice in how you approach the exam. At most grade levels, you can choose pieces from different style groups — classical, jazz, contemporary — and build a programme that reflects your interests. They also offer "digital grades" which can be recorded and submitted online rather than performed in person.

Trinity's marking criteria place a strong emphasis on musical communication and overall performance quality, rather than just technical accuracy. Some students find this approach less stressful and more encouraging.

### Best for

Students who enjoy a mix of musical styles, those who want more flexibility in piece selection, and students who might prefer the option of digital (recorded) exams.

## So Which Should You Choose?

Honestly, there's no wrong answer. All three are excellent exam boards and any grade from RIAM, ABRSM, or Trinity is equally valid. Here are a few practical considerations:

- **Staying in Ireland?** RIAM is the most convenient and widely recognised locally.
- **Want flexibility in styles?** Trinity gives you the most freedom to mix classical with jazz and pop.
- **Thinking internationally?** ABRSM has the broadest global recognition.
- **Prefer recorded exams?** Trinity's digital grades are a unique option.

The most important thing is that your teacher knows the syllabus well and can prepare you properly for whichever board you choose. At Sandycove School of Music, we prepare students for all three exam boards and can help you decide which is the best fit based on your goals, your strengths, and your musical interests.
